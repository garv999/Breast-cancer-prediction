# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on cell nucleus features extracted from breast tissue images.

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection and classification of breast tumors, aiding in timely diagnosis and treatment decisions. The model analyzes features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

## üìÇ Dataset & Features

I have used the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**, which includes:

- **Diagnosis**:  
  - `M` = Malignant  
  - `B` = Benign  

- **Features (10 real-valued features for each cell nucleus):**
  - Radius: Mean distance from center to points on the perimeter
  - Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
  - Perimeter
  - Smoothness
  - Compactness: (area/perimeter - 1.0)
  - Concavity
  - Concave points
  - Symmetry
  - Fractal dimension

- Selected important biological and clinical features  
- Collaborated with medical domain knowledge for insights  

### 3. Model Selection & Training
- Used binary classification algorithms like:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Neural Networks  
- Tuned hyperparameters and used cross-validation

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**

## üìä Results (Cross-Validation)

- Employed **k-Fold Cross Validation** (k=5,10)
- Achieved strong performance across all metrics
- Compared against baseline models and validated externally for robustness

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Potential data imbalance and demographic bias
- Interpretability concerns with complex models
- Limited sample size from the dataset
- Need for real-world clinical validation
- Ethical considerations (privacy, fairness, trust)
